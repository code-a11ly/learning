# :rocket: Let's learn programing?

### :page_facing_up: About:
this is a repository that I created to from the notes
that I was and am making about programing to try to help
people to learn it

### :computer: What do you need to follow along:

 - A computer
 - A text editor
    - I recommend vscode or sublime
      cause both are free and simple to use

### :mag_right: What you will find here?

In this repo you will find notes about the following
languages:

    - Python
    - C++
    - JavaScript
    - PHP

__NOTE:__ As per natural this is will not be a full guide to
any programing language, as they are just notes that I took
along my leaning jorney, and too do not contain eveything
that I know about them.
