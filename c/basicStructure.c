#include <stdio.h>      // to do something inside c you need
                        // the include a library into your code
                        // the stdio for example is the standart
                        // input and output library

int main()    // the main function is the most important
              // funtion of the code cuz here is where all
              // the code of your program will be really
              // executed
{
    /*
    ALL THE CODE
    THAT YOU NEED TO EXECUTE
    GOES INSIDE HERE
    */

    return 0;      // the return 0 in main is used to
                   // show the code that if it returns 0
                   // then everything went well
