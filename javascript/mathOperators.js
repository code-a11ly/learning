// ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

/*
    A computer is simply a more "smart" calculator
    and to think of programing without doing simple
    operations is unlogic

    so the Math or Arithemetic Operators are:

    + for addition
    - for subtraction
    * for multiplication
    / for division
    % for getting the interger value that resulted
        from a division between a odd and a even number
*/

// and following there are some examples:

var addition = 3 + 2;
var subtraction = 3 - 70;
var division = 10 / 2;
var multiplication = 3 * 10;
var interger = 3 % 2;


console.log(addition);
console.log(subtraction);
console.log(division);
console.log(multiplication);
console.log(interger);
