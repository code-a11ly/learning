// VARIABLE TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT

/*
    In JavaScript (Js) differently to other
    prrograming languages we don't declare the 
    variable type, but let the own language
    interpret which kind of variable we are
    using
*/

var name = "john";  // this is a string type variable
var age = 19;   // this is a interger type variable
var married = false;    // this is a boolean type variable
var profession = undefined;     // this is a non define variable

var person = {                      // we have the object type
    name: "gabriel",                // variables as well
    age: 19,                        // they can store a lot more
    hasDriversLicense: false,       // information than a single variable
    dateOfBirth: "10/01/2002",      // and in a much more detailed way

    address: {                      // we can even create an object
        firstLine: "123",           // inside another object
        postCode: "SE1",
        country: "Brazil"

    }
